- StopLoss: The stop loss level in pips (default: 50).
- TakeProfit: The take profit level in pips (default: 100).

## How It Works

The Kubota Expert Advisor uses a neural network to analyze market data and make predictions on the EUR/USD currency pair. The neural network is initialized in the OnInit() function using the ANN_ARCHITECTURE, ANN_LEARNING_RATE, and ANN_MOMENTUM parameters.

In the OnTick() function, the Expert Advisor retrieves the current market data using the GetMarketData() function. It then passes this data to the neural network's Predict() function to obtain a prediction.

If the prediction is positive, indicating a buy signal, the Expert Advisor opens a buy position using the trade.Buy() function. If the prediction is negative, indicating a sell signal, the Expert Advisor opens a sell position using the trade.Sell() function.

The Expert Advisor continuously monitors market data and makes trading decisions based on the predictions of the neural network.
